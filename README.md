# Object Oriented Drawing Program
Submission piece for Object-Oriented Programming, BScs Computer Science.


### Description:


<img align="right" img src="https://gdurl.com/QDut">

This simple Drawing Program was created to help demonstrate the benefit of Polymorphism in Object Oriented Programming.  Circles, Squares and Lines can be drawn on the screen by the user, and are created from individual classes. <br>

The benefit of Polymorphism is introduced when we isolate the properties that these Shapes have in common, and place them in a parent Class from which they can be inherited as required.<br>

Squares, Circles, Rectangles and Triangles are all different kinds of Shapes, but can still be grouped together as Shapes; that is they all each hold a unique point of origin, a size, a colour.<br>

When we abstract these properties into a higher Parent class, we not only reduce the amount of data stored within each individual Shape/Object, we also allow for each different shape to be morphed or altered in the same way, 'Poly' meaning many, and 'morphism' meaning ability to change. <br>
